**Proof-Transport**: keep proofs valid when the proof kernel changes.  
Automatically transport sequent proofs across rule-set updates (e.g., remove `Cut`) and emit stability certificates.

## ✅ What CI checks
- Rust crate builds successfully  
- JSON examples are schema‑valid  
- BEFORE proofs contain a `Cut`  
- AFTER proofs have no `Cut`  
- Node count decreases (fragility drop)
