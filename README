**Proof-Transport**: keep proofs valid when the proof kernel changes.  
Automatically transport sequent proofs across rule-set updates (e.g., remove `Cut`) and emit stability certificates.

---

## ✅ What CI checks
- Rust crate builds successfully  
- JSON examples are schema‑valid  
- BEFORE proofs contain a `Cut`  
- AFTER proofs have no `Cut`  
- Node count decreases (fragility drop)

##  About Us
**SequentLabs** is building resilient proof infrastructure.  

- Core maintainer: lead developer & architect  
- Collaborators: Lean/Coq/Agda researchers and cryptography engineers  
- Community: open to contributors via GitHub issues and discussions  

Our mission: keep formal proofs alive under kernel evolution, lowering re-verification costs for critical systems.

##  Timeline (6 months)

| Month | Milestones |
|-------|------------|
| 1–2   | FO substitution correctness tests; golden FO proofs |
| 2–3   | Exporter prototypes (Lean subset, Coq via SerAPI) |
| 3–4   | Benchmarks on large DAGs; performance memo results; web viz polish |
| 4–5   | External trial with partner; ZK contract spec draft |
| 5–6   | Paper draft (CPP/LFMTP); community onboarding (3+ contributors) |


##  Evaluation & Metrics

- ≥10 golden tests (prop + FO)  
- Transport 10k-node DAG < 500ms  
- 2 exporters (Lean/Coq subsets)  
- ≥3 external contributors/users  
- 1 artifact badge at CPP/LFMTP  
- Public web viz demo online

##  Who Uses Proof-Transport

- **Formal verification teams:** keep Lean/Coq proofs valid when kernels evolve.  
- **Blockchain auditors:** resilient smart-contract proofs when policies change.  
- **AI safety researchers:** preserve long-lived safety proofs as specs update.  
- **Compliance teams:** machine-checkable continuity of evidence under evolving standards.
